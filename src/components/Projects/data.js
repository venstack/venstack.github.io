I have started my working by going through lot of literatures like harry foundalis dissertation and his device phaeco and started working on it in the tensorflow and started solving the puzzles given by the problem and was able to create a network in which i was using the 11 years out which 9 are convolutuional layers and 2 are pooling layers.'

    description: 'High quality probabilistic models for a complex robot like Aldebaranâ€™s Nao humanoid depend heavily on details from its environment, involving multiple parameters. Building such models requires significant effort with data gathering and data cleaning. We propose to create a public database of NAO sensor data that can be used by researchers and engineers training models for localization, mapping, and planning in controlled environments. Here we report on our release of a database with sensor data, parameterized by environment configuration and nature. The database contains structured folders with documentation, measurements, Nao AI feedback, and data management tools. The measurements can include transition, sonar, and image data while the internal AI feedback contains results of default landmark detection.',
