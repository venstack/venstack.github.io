export const about = 'I was born in November 6, 1995 in Kurnool, India. Since my childhood, i have been very passionate about computers and learning about new technologies. This made me pursue  Computer Science in Manipal Institute of Technology, which is one of the prestigious universities in India. After finishing my education, i have joined a start up organization known as publishat as an intern in 2017 in order to thrive my career. The idea of digitizing the personal information has become more inﬂuential in my path of career, where i played a major part in the development of Publishat.com and the respective apps on iOS and android. We came up with a new idea of remote print technology where users can print their data from their current location to the closest printer center location. We also thought about making the bookmarks accessible and inter operable between browsers and can be accessed globally and we categorize the bookmarks for the users which lead me to present the project in PDA conference 2019 in the University of Pittsburgh. The problem with the application is there is lot of meta data to ﬁll in to upload the record which made me think that if we intelligence to the computer to grab the information from the record and i started working on OCR which wasn’t very precise.This led me to be enthusiastic about the NLP and then i started learning about machine learning and convolutional neural networks. Currently, i have been working on the Bongard problem, which is a series of figures following a certain rule and the other series which breaks the given rule.'
